rayTracer
=========

Ray tracer written in C++.

To compile the code run make file.

TO run the code :
./rayTracer <obj_file_path> <command_file_path>
for example : ./rayTracer scenes/scene01/model.obj scenes/scene01/commands

I have provided 4 scenes in the scenes directory with the output.The output generated will be ppm file.

Other samples(converted to jpeg) generated by this code are also available at the top level project directory.
